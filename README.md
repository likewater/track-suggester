#Welcome to the Epicodus Track Suggester.

###By answering a few simple questions you can be presented with several track choices. If you have design skills and coding chops then your choice might be harder. But typically you should stick with your strengths.

###This is the initial release (1.0). Check out my page on gh-pages: https://likewater.github.io/track-suggester/

#Getting Started

#Inspiration

###Thanks to so many unnameable people whose projects I have taken note of and gained inspiration from. I hope to someday provide some inspiration to anyone that stumbles upon this page. Thanks to Douglas Crockford for writing JS books that even I can understand.
