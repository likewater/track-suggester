          <h3>Our Track Recommendations Are Below</h3>
          <h4>The recommendation provided reflects a suitable development track based on your answers.</h4></br>
          <div id="designTrack">
            <h3>CSS and Design</h3>
            <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual and aural layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.
            </p>
            <p>Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces.

          <div id="javaTrack">
            <h3>Java and Android</h3>
            <p>Java is a programming language used to create dynamic web applications, applets within larger Web pages, and mobile Android applications. Students who learn java programming will be able to create dynamic web applications on their computer. Most Java students also continue into our Android course, where they learn how to create mobile apps for Android devices.
            </p></br>
            <p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on The Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. After launching 2003, Android is the most popular operating system and used for a variety of purposes, including running mobile apps, taking photos, sending messages, etc.

          <div id="railsTrack">
            <h3>Rails or Drupal</h3>
            <p>Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby language and typically referred to as “Ruby on Rails”. It is meant to make programming applications easier by writing code more efficiently. Rails programming can accomplish much more than many other frameworks and languages because less code needs to be written to complete tasks. Portland companies using Ruby on Rails who have hired Epicodus graduates include New Relic, LivingSocial, and SpendWell.
            </p></br>
            <p>Drupal is content management software (CMS) that is used to create and manage various types of websites. It allows for easy content authoring, strong security, and consistent performance. Drupal modules extend its functionality, while Drupal themes allow for customization of content presentation. Students who learn Drupal will be able to build structured and organized sites quickly and efficiently.

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>The most important thing for us is to find students who are excited about working closely with others and have good communication skills.
            </p>
            For our evening classes, it's fine if you haven't done any programming before, but for our full-time program, we want to know that you've at least spent a few hours playing around with it. We'd hate for you to find out you don't like coding and drop out shortly after our class starts.
            </p>
            After you submit your application, we'll contact you within two weeks to set up a phone interview. After the phone interview, we'll let you know if you're accepted within two weeks. If you're accepted, you'll have one week to decide whether you'd like to enroll and make your first payment.
            </p>
            We consider applications on a rolling basis. There are no deadlines, but the earlier you apply, the better your chances of being accepted.
